    Usage: main clip [OPTIONS] MODEL MODEL_ROOT MODEL_DESTINATION REGION
    
      Create a new model based on clipped region of an existing model. If the
      existing model contains forcing, they will also be clipped to the new model.
    
      For options to build wflow models see:
    
      Example usage to clip a wflow model for a subbasin derived from point coordinates
      snapped to cells with stream order >= 4
      hydromt clip wflow /path/to/model_root /path/to/model_destination "{'subbasin': [-7.24, 62.09], 'wflow_streamorder': 4}"
    
      Example usage basin based on ID from model_root basins map
      hydromt clip wflow /path/to/model_root /path/to/model_destination "{'basin': 1}"
    
      Example usage basins whose outlets are inside a geometry
      hydromt clip wflow /path/to/model_root /path/to/model_destination "{'outlet': 'geometry.geojson'}"
